_**Patches sculk shriekers so that they react to redstone-triggered signals**_

## What Does This Mod Do?

In the early snapshots for Minecraft 1.19, sculk shriekers could be activated by redstone.
One the version actually released, however, not only could shriekers only be triggered
by sensors, but sensors that were triggered by any "unnatural" movement (read: not belonging
to the player) would no longer trigger a shrieker.

On the whole this is probably a good thing, otherwise every time a bat spawned in the Deep Dark,
it would be like _Night of the Living Dead_ all up and down y=-51.

However, not being able to set off _synthetic_ (placed) shriekers with, say, a timer is kind of
a bummer. So this mod patches that behavior so that The Player can wake up every morning with
the Mother of All Alarm Clocks.

### Planned Features
Future updates may include the ability to configure this mod:
- to allow naturally spawning (`can_summon`) shriekers to be triggered as well
- to have placed shriekers inflict the Darkness effect.
